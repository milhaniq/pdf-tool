A powerful, browser-based toolkit to **merge, split, compress, convert PDF files to PowerPoint (PPTX) or Excel (.xlsx), and annotate PDFs** — all client-side, with no server uploads required.
Built using **HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, PDF-Lib, PDF.js, JSZip, SortableJS, PptxGenJS, and SheetJS**.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **Merge PDFs**

* Drag & drop multiple PDF files
* Reorder files easily using drag-and-drop
* Clear individual files or all at once
* Download merged PDF instantly

### ✂️ **Split PDF**

* Upload a single PDF
* Split into:

  * Individual pages
  * Specific page ranges (e.g., `1-3, 5, 7-10`)
* Export results as a ZIP file

### 🔁 **PDF → PPTX Converter**

* Convert PDF pages into high-quality PowerPoint slides
* Optional:

  * **Preserve aspect ratio**
  * **High-quality rendering**
* Live progress bar
* Download as `.pptx`

### 📊 **PDF → Excel Converter**

* Extract tables and data from PDFs into Excel spreadsheets
* Features:

  * **Automatic table detection** using position-based clustering
  * **Multiple tables per page** detection
  * **Auto-fit column widths**
  * **Header detection** and bold formatting
  * **Auto-filter** for easy data sorting
* Live progress bar with confidence indicators
* Download as `.xlsx`

**⚠️ Accuracy Notice:** Works best with simple, native PDFs containing clear tabular data. Complex layouts, scanned documents, or merged cells may have reduced accuracy. Since this is 100% client-side (for your privacy), we continuously improve our algorithms but perfect conversion isn't always possible.

### 🗜️ **Compress PDF**

* Drag & drop one or many PDFs and compress the whole batch at once
* Pick a preset — Smallest file, Strong, Balanced, Light, or Scanned text
* Or fine-tune it yourself:

  * **Resolution (DPI)** — 40 to 300
  * **Image quality** — JPEG quality 10% to 95%
  * **Colour mode** — keep colour, greyscale, or black & white
* **Safe mode** keeps the original file whenever compression would not make it smaller
* Per-file results table showing original size, compressed size, and percentage saved
* Download files individually or grab them all as a ZIP

**⚠️ Rasterisation Notice:** Compression re-renders each page as an image, so text in the output is no longer selectable or searchable. Use 150–200 DPI if the file must stay readable when printed; 72–96 DPI is fine for email and screen viewing.

### ✏️ **PDF Annotation**

* Upload any PDF document (forms, reports, etc.)
* Annotate with multiple tools:

  * **Text boxes** - Add text anywhere on the page
  * **Highlighter** - Highlight text with semi-transparent overlay
  * **Arrows** - Draw arrows to point to specific content
  * **Shapes** - Draw rectangles, circles, and lines
* Customize annotations:

  * Choose from any color
  * Adjust line thickness
  * Move and resize annotations
  * Delete individual annotations or clear all
* Navigate between pages while preserving annotations
* Download annotated PDF with all changes burned in
* Touch-friendly for mobile devices

### 🔐 **100% Client-Side**

All processing happens inside the browser.
No files are uploaded, stored, or sent to any server.

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Direct File Access (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-tools-suite.git
cd pdf-tools-suite
```

2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser

✔ **No build steps needed**
✔ **No dependencies to install**
✔ **Works offline after first load**

### Option 2: Live Server (For Development)

If you prefer to run a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## 🧪 How It Works (Technical Summary)

### PDF Merge

* Reads all files using `File.arrayBuffer()`
* Uses **PDF-Lib** to load each document and copy pages into a new PDF
* Creates a downloadable Blob using `URL.createObjectURL()`

### PDF Split

* Loads the uploaded PDF using **PDF-Lib**
* Creates separate PDFs for pages or ranges
* Packages output using **JSZip**

### PDF Compression

* Renders every page to a canvas at the chosen DPI using **PDF.js**
* Optionally converts the canvas to greyscale or thresholded black & white
* Re-encodes each page as a JPEG and embeds it into a new PDF with **PDF-Lib**, keeping the original page dimensions
* Saves with object streams enabled for a further size reduction
* Compares the result against the source and keeps the original when compression does not help (safe mode)
* Packages a multi-file batch into a ZIP using **JSZip**

### PDF → PPTX Conversion

* Renders each page as a canvas image using **PDF.js**
* Inserts each image as a slide in **PptxGenJS**
* Exports the `.pptx` file client-side

### PDF → Excel Conversion

* Extracts text content from PDF using **PDF.js**
* Detects tabular structures using custom algorithms:
  - Groups text items by Y-coordinates (rows)
  - Clusters X-coordinates (columns)
  - Validates grid structure
  - Reconstructs cells from positioned text
* Generates Excel workbook using **SheetJS**
* Applies formatting: auto-fit columns, bold headers, auto-filter
* Exports the `.xlsx` file client-side

### PDF Annotation

* Renders PDF pages using **PDF.js** on a canvas
* Overlays a second canvas for drawing annotations
* Stores annotations as objects with type, coordinates, and properties
* Supports multiple annotation types: text, highlight, arrow, rectangle, circle, line
* On download, uses **PDF-Lib** to burn annotations into the PDF:
  * Converts canvas coordinates to PDF coordinates
  * Draws text, shapes, and highlights using PDF-lib's graphics API
  * Preserves original PDF quality while adding annotations
* All processing happens client-side with no server uploads

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Password-protected or corrupted PDFs may fail to load
* Very large PDFs may cause high memory usage in the browser
* **Compression is lossy and rasterising:** output pages are images, so text is no longer selectable, searchable, or copyable, and already-optimised PDFs may not shrink at all (safe mode keeps the original in that case)
* PowerPoint quality depends on screen resolution and rendering settings
* **Excel conversion accuracy varies:**
  * Works best with simple, native PDFs with clear tabular data (85-95% accuracy)
  * Medium complexity PDFs: 70-85% accuracy
  * Complex layouts, scanned documents, or merged cells: 50-70% accuracy
  * Scanned PDFs (images) require OCR (not currently supported)
